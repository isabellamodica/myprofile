											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Isabella Modica and my cultural background is Italian, my grandparents were all born in Italy and migrated to Australia. 
											I am in my final year, studying a Bachelor of Business (Information Systems) and set to graduate at the end of year. 
											In my spare time, I like to keep fit and exercise by either going for a run or walk or watch a tv serious or movie on Netflix</p>

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									My passion and interest in IT has originated from my dad, who works as an IT Sales Executive at IBM. 
									He has always encouraged me to pursue a career in information technology as it is a growing industry. 
									high school, in year 10, I did my work experience at IBM. 
									During this week I was exposed to many innovative projects such as Watson, a robot built by using artificial intelligence. 
									I was so intrigued that from this day onwards, I knew I wanted to pursue a career within the IT industry.  </p> 
									<br>
									<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
									<p>
										The main reason I chose to study at RMIT is the reputation it incurs. RMIT is well known for the business school and offered a course which I was highly fascinated in, Bachelor of Business - Information Systems. 
										I attended the open day and knew this is the university I wanted to study at. 
										Additionally, it has prime location in heart of Melbourne and the commute was quick and easy. 
										I also have many relatives and friends that had graduated from RMIT who now all have jobs and are very successful. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Originally, I was completing the Business Information Systems applied course, where in third year I was to do an internship. 
										Due to the COVID pandemic, very few firms and organisations were taking interns and was not successful in getting one. 
										Therefore, I decided to drop down finish at the end of the year to complete the three year non-applied course. 
										From my studies, I have learnt a whole new range of IT skills including different coding languages and programs as well as the business aspects of IT and innovation.

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
								</header>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/facerec.png" alt="" /> </span>
									<p>
										<b>
											Overview:
										</b> 
										The project idea that I am introducing is an ATM machine that uses facial recognition including biometric authentication, to replace a PIN. 
										With the use of complex technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud services and machine learning, this enhanced ATM will allow users to withdraw their money in a more secure and efficient way. 
										These machines will be very simple to use and minimise the amount of contact between users and the machine, limiting the spread of COVID.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Motivation: 
										</b>
											My the main reason for implementing an ATM that uses facial recognition is to enhance the security to protect users’ data and their money. 
											It will reduce money laundering from stolen cards, fraud, malware attacks as well as increase theft prevention. Facial recognition software are highly precise, achieving 'accuracy scores as high as 99.97% on standard assessments like NIST’s Facial Recognition Vendor Test' (Crumpler, 2020). 
											This project will be useful as it make users’ withdrawal experience safer and more secure.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Description: 
										</b>
										The project that is being introduced is an ATM that uses facial recognition technology where the ATM simply scans the user's face when they are withdrawing money. 
										In the current context of COVID-19 pandemic, this project will lower the spread and reduce physical contact on surfaces as users will not need to touch as many buttons and enter in PIN numbers in order to withdraw their funds.
									</p>
								<p>Essentially, introducing the biometric authentication (facial recognition), will replace the use of a PIN number. 
									This process will remain very similar to a standard ATM. However, when the user received their card for the first time, they will need to take a photo which will be stored on their profile.
									When withdrawing money, the facial recognition scan compares their facial signature with the photo stored on their profile to identify and authorise the transaction. 
								</p>
								<p>
									A user will swipe their card and rather than getting asked to insert their PIN number, they will stand in front of the camera whilst the machine scans their face.
									The algorithms and softwares read the geometrics of the user's face. Key features that are examined during this process such as the 'distance between your eyes and the distance from forehead to chin' (Symanovich, 2019) which builds up an individual profile, resulting in a facial signature.
									The facial signature is unique to every person, composed of many complex algorithms and mathematical formulas that gets stored onto a database with millions of users. Once the face has been scanned, if it matches the image stored on the profile, then it authorises the user to withdraw their funds.
									If accepted and the face matches, the user simply selects their required amount and they can collect their money from the ATM as per usual procedures. 
								</p>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/money.png" alt="" /> </span>
								<p>
									Users will have three attempts if their face is not recognised as there must be room for any errors.
									For example, if a user is wearing glasses and does not recognise their facial signature, then they will have the opportunity to take off their glasses and try again.
									However, if they are denied access three times, they will get an automatic email stating that someone has unsuccessfully tried getting into the account and will need to unlock it.
									This will help identify criminal activity and ensures that fraudulent acts are minimised, notifying the user to potentially cancel or change their card. The ATM will only allow to store one photo per user on their account.
									If there are any dramatic or significant physical changes, the must update their selected photo to ensure that they do not get locked out. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The facial recognition ATM will simplify the user experience and increase the security aspects when withdrawing money.
									There may be some drawbacks such as failure to recognise the user or potential damage to the camera.
									For these reasons, there will be a ‘report’ button on the ATM which will notify assistance to either guide the user or make it so it will be out of order.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Tools and Technologies: 
									</b>
									Tools and technologies needed in order to build the ATM is firstly, a camera must be installed on the ATM to perform the facial recognition.
									Complex algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (Thakur et al. 2009), will be used to implement the biometric authentication.
									Enhanced security and cyber procedures will need to be installed as the ATM is storing data relating to users' finances and private details.
									There will also need to be an additional 'report' button in case there is an issue where the user would like to report.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Skills Required:
									</b>
									Overall, the biometric authentication ATM will be very similar in the way it works compared to a normal ATM.
									Rather than entering a PIN number, the user will be authenticated by facial recognition.
									Therefore, users and staff will not need to be significantly trained in order use the new machine.
									Although there will need to be softwares and databases created, facial recognition has been used in phones and other forms of technology for a a few years now and is not a brand new technological prospect.
									It will be quite feasible to implement this software and to program and install it into an ATM.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Outcome:
									</b>
									If this project is successful, facial recognition ATM's will eventually replace all ATM's both nationally and worldwide.
									It will enhance the security of ATM's, expose criminals as well as lower fraud and cyber attacks.
									Additionally, it will help minimise the spread of COVID-19 as users will not have to touch as many buttons in order to withdraw their funds from their account.
